# IMS Wiki

This repository houses useful resources and guides for your years of study.

This wiki is maintained by students, and is frequently updated.

## Version Guarantees

As a rule, IMS officially endorses *only* the latest commit on the main branch at any given time.

Our commit guidelines prohibit drastic changes without necessary review, and any major rewrites will be announced in
the relevant channels.

## Contributing

Contributing to this guide is a straightforward process. Simply fork [this repo][docs], add your changes and submit a
pull request.

To find sections that need contributions, search for `TODO: fixme` in this repository.

[docs]: https://github.com/indian-medical-server/docs

### Guidelines

We have some base rules about "good" PRs. These aren't enforced by checks yet, but may be in the near future.

- Must validate using [markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint)
  - You can check out other files in this repo for a fair idea, if you don't want to install this tool
  - Use `markdownlint-disable` directives sparingly
- Limit lines to 125 characters or fewer
- Run your contribution through a spellchecker
