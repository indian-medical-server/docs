# Clinical Resource recommendations by Raun

## ENT

Text -> Parsons/Khurana
Practicals -> I just focused on my postings

## PSM

Text -> Have to have to do PARKS !! (Read once, learn definitions/Headings at the very least)
Practicals -> Any source but you need to learn how to take a general case history in med/surg/peds/obgy + PSM ka history alag se

Most of it is pretty easy, if you want you could supplement video lectures from Marrow/Prepladder with it, although I did not personally use any

## MEDICINE

Text -> Boloor/Davidson + Your notes (Any source, but I would recommend you have a pair of notes from one of the video lectures ready !)
Practicals -> PJ Mehta + Kundu + Ghanshyam Vaidya/White Army videos
(I personally used Ghanshyam Vaidya, they're shorter and probably more high yield, esp for MUHS?)

Might wanna keep your 2nd year patho books like Robbins handy for haematology

## SURGERY

Text -> Would really suggest you to take out the time to read Bailey+ your notes! (Notes from Marrow/Prep/Dams)
If you do not have any of the above resources, I would recommend either Manipal or SRB because it could get really hard writing answers from Bailey alone !

Practicals -> S. Das + Ghanshyam Vaidya Videos (White army too?)

## OBGY

Text -> Shaw and Dutta +/- Notes
There is another chotu sa book by Bhojani, so if you're short on time you could use that !
Practicals -> I used a book called Virkud, but theres videos on White Army too. Study contraception !

## PAEDS

Text -> Theres only Ghai !! But you'd maybe refer medicine quite a few times because most of the topics in systemic paeds overlap!!
Practicals -> People usually use Aruchami Laxmanswami, Or Kumar but i didn't really have time for either so I just studied theory, and case format from Medicine !

## RADIO

-> Gets covered in Surgery (+Medicine)
-> www.radiopaedia.com

## ORTHO

-> Text : Maheshwari
-> Practicals : Maheshwari

## DERMA & PSYCH & Anaesthesia
